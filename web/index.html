    <h1>Cake Wars</h1>
    <p>Stop the Cake master race before they assert their world domination by global teeth decay!<br/>
    You drive your Pear ship and shoot Water Melons at the flying Cakes. Only their sugar bullets will hurt you.<br/>
    WASD to steer and Space bar to shoot! Enemies drop guns and life randomly.<br/>
    How many waves can you survive?</p>
